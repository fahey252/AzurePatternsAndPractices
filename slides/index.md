##Christopher Fahey

note:
Patterns and Practices team at Microsoft (24 Design patterns)  
Discuss benefits and considerations for patterns.  
Cloud computing -> running on other peoples hardware  
Build in a manner to get as much value as possible  
Avoid cascading failures, excessive charges, stateful VM's  
Pattern = Problem -> Solutions.  
Can blend patterns, deviate when it makes sense.  
Goal is cover all the patterns, but go in depth on interesting patterns.
Patterns offer flexible solutions to common problems in software development.
