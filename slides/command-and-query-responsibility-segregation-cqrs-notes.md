###Problem
Traditional CRUD designs work well when there is only limited business logic applied to the data operations.

###Solution
Segregate operations that read(queries) and update(commands) data. Use Separate interfaces.

####Notes
  * Data models used for querying and updates are different.
  * CQRS code cannot automatically be generated by using scaffold mechanisms.

note: 
Separation of the read and write stores also allows __each to be scaled appropriately__ to match the load.
